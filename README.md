# decision-making-process
This is Trans Rally's decision making process for each working group.

The intention is to create a decision making process that each working group can follow in order to standardize and continuously improve.

We also want to maintain transparency so our members can understand and suggest improvements.

Our hope is, by having this as a separate process that lives outside of each working group, it will provide instructions and clarity for each group to function effectively.
